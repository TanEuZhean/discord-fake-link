  <meta property="og:title" content="Faker's second pentakill" />
  <meta property="og:description" content='Lee "Faker" Sang-hyeok secured the second pentakill of his long and storied career this morning, playing Ahri against DRXâ€”just one day after his 29th birthday. His first pentakill came over a decade ago in the LCK Spring 2015, on LeBlanc during a series against NaJin e-mFire. This latest one is especially symbolic for the League of Legends GOAT, as it came on Ahri, one of his signature champions. Fittingly, when inducted into the Hall of Legends, Faker chose two champions for his commemorative skins: LeBlanc and Ahri. The circle is now complete.' />
